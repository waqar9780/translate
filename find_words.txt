def wordcount(filename, listwords):   
    try:

    file = open( filename, "r")   

    read = file.readlines()
    file.close()
    for x in listwords:
        y = x.lower()
        counter = 0
        for z in read:
            line = z.split()
            for ss in line:
                l = ss.lower()
            if y == l:
                 counter += 1

        print(y , counter)     
Now I try to recall the function with a txt file and the word to find

 wordcount("t8.shakespeare.txt" , 'word' )
